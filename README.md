# Everchron Coding Challenges

The tests in this repo are designed to allow us to get an initial sense of your coding skills before continuing the interview process. The challenges are pretty straight forward, and shouldn't take anymore than a few hours to complete. If you're having trouble understanding the instructions, or have any questions do not hesitate to reach out.

### Code Review
For these tests we value quality over completeness. It is fine to skip certain steps provided you mention them in your project's README.

The aspects of your code we will review include:

- Code quality: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags?   Is the coding style follow the language's best practices? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
- Correctness: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- Tests: are tests included? If not, why? How complete/readable are the tests?

### Wrapping Up
